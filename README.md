# Data-analysis-projects
This repository contains my personal data analysis learning projects.  
I am currently exploring:  
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib)  
- SQL (data queries and case studies)  
- Excel (data cleaning and dashboards)  

Each folder contains datasets, code, and explanations of what I learned.
